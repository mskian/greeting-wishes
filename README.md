# Greeting Maker ðŸŽ‰  

Send warm and personalized greeting wishes to your friends and family members. Enter your name to receive a custom greeting wishes for the festive season.  

**Note**  

"I've created a personalized Greeting Wishes site for my friends and family members,hosted on my Private VPS server.The network is tunneled via Cloudflare Argo Tunnel <https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/>."  

"Termux has compatibility issues with NPM Canvas, so I recommend using a VPS server with Ubuntu, Node.js LTS, PNPM, PM2, and Cloudflare Tunnel. Thereâ€™s no need to install servers like Nginx, Apache2, or Caddy.simply use Cloudflare Tunnel for reverse proxying."
